Redistribution of derivatives ( a note added by Mark Watins )
-----------------------------
Mark Watkins created this software to help lessen the exploitation of others. Seeing his work being used to exploit others
is incredibly un-motivational, and incredibly disrespectful of all the work he put into this project.

If you plan on reselling any derivatives of SleepyHead, I specifically request that you give due credit and
link back, mentioning clearly in your advertising material, software installer and about screens that your
derivative "is based on the free and open-source software SleepyHead available from http://sleepyhead.jedimark.net,
developed and copyright by Mark Watkins (C) 2011-2018."

It is not enough to reference that your derivative "is based on GPL software".
